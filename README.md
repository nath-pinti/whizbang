# Whizbang win-rate calculator (Blizzard game: Hearthstone, Heroes of Warcraft)

In the game 'Hearth Stone' by Blizzard Entertainment, there is a card called 'Whizbang the Wonderful.' When you queue up for a match with this card in a deck, the game will assign you a random, premade, deck out of a pool of 18 total decks.

PURPOSE: This program uses HS Deck Tracker data (a 3rd party Hearthstone stats app) to calculate the total win rate of all your WHIZBANG decks combined!
 *To my knowledge, this is not yet a feature available on the HS Deck Tracker app

CONDITIONS needed to run this program:
Enter all Whizbang decks into deck tracker and start the name of each of them with 'Whizbang'.
The 'DeckStats.xml' file (can be found at %AppData%\HearthstoneDeckTracker) must be copied into your python IDE directory

Hearthstone deck tracker can be downloaded here: https://hsdecktracker.net/

Whizbang deck codes can be found here: https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1163078-all-whizbang-decks-for-your-decktracker
  *Use the import function on the app to add these decks to deck tracker and remember to start the deck name with 'Whizbang'
